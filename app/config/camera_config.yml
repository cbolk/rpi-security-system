##### TUNE-ABLE VARIABLES #####

# The minimum number of consecutive frames containing motion before an image can
# be uploaded
min_motion_frames: 8

# The minimum area size of an image (in pixels) for a region to be considered
# motion or not. Smaller values will lead to more areas marked as motion,
# whereas higher values of min_area  will only mark larger regions as motion
min_area: 5000

# The number of seconds to wait in between uploads.
occ_min_upload_seconds: 5.0

# The number of seconds to wait in between no motion detected uploads.
unocc_min_upload_seconds: 600

# Number of frames to store and save with each image
frame_store_cnt: 300


##### CAMERA SETTINGS - THINGS I WON'T BE OPTIMIZING #####

# alpha regulates the update speed (how fast the accumulator forgets about earlier images)
# higher: average image tries to catch even very fast and short changes in the data
# lower: average becomes sluggish and it won't consider fast changes in the input images
alpha: 0.1

# Number of dilate iterations after thresholding
dilate_iterations: 2

# Kernel size for gaussian blurring
ksize: [21, 21]

# The minimum absolute value difference between our current frame and averaged
# frame for a given pixel to be triggered as motion. Smaller values will lead
# to more motion being detected, larger values to less motion detected.
delta_thresh: 5

# The width and height of the video frame from our Raspberry Pi camera
resolution: [640, 480]

# The desired Frames Per Second from our Raspberry Pi camera
fps: 10

# number of pixels in the frame
frame_width: 500

# Vertically flip the camera
vflip: True

# Horizontally flip the camera
hflip: True
